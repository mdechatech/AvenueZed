TRAFFIC SIM + TOWER DEFENSE
"Supply Side Zombies"
"AVENUE ZED"!!!!

maintain a supply chain intersection in a zombie apocalypse
COPY: I Love Traffic, pretty much every tower defense game

Gameplay 1 - turn on/off traffic lights to direct traffic
Gameplay 2 - place towers and watch them go

GOAL: level-based, pass atleast x cars and maintain y avg travel time (rolling avg of prev. x cars) within z time limit

Each level is split into waves, each level represents a different city block with different road connections and zombie spawns

If zombies reach the streets they may cause congestion or other adverse effects

Special vehicles may give bonuses once they exit the map, causes player to think about priorities; examples:
 - cargo truck - keeps towers supplied with ammunition
 - transport   - worth multiple cars, reduce zombie spawnrate
 - limousine   - extra money for building towers
